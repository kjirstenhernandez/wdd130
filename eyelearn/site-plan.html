      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>It's a common misconception that because someone seems to have perfect vision they don't 
        need eye exams or glasses, but there are several conditions that can affect learning and reading and are largely undetectable 
        except through a cover test and near-point checking during an eye exam, and would be easily treated with reading glasses or eye exercises.  
        This website will help raise awareness on these concerns, as well as teach people about common injuries that I see happening more often to 
        kids than adults due to the nature of the injury -- most frequently hyphemas from nerf guns.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience would be primarily parents, especially those who have kids in grade school or in college, but teachers and educators 
        as well would benefit from the knowledge.  It may also interest individuals who are hoping to gain a greater understanding of the eye and the 
        lesser known anomalies of vision in relation to learning and development. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Most people won’t argue when you say that any parent or teacher’s primary concern is the health 
        and well-being of a child, and that eyes are essential for development. However,  most people also 
        don’t think about how connected both of those things are!  At EyeLearn we hope to raise awareness 
        for the things that people oftentimes don’t know, and wouldn’t know unless you’ve either attended 
        Medical School or Optometry School, that can hurt kids either physically or academically.

      <h3>Vision and the Classroom</h3>
      <p>
        80% of what we learn comes from vision, and recently studies have shown that 60% of "problem-learners" 
        have an undiagnosed eye disorder.  How did that happen?  Because school screenings only focus on distance 
        vision. Nearsightedness, meaning things at a distance appear blurred but clearer closer-up, poses the biggest
        risk to learning, there are still many vision disorders that happen at near-vision whic can still greatly impede
        learning, and tend to be much harder to detect.  This is why taking your child for an eye exam before they start
        school is so important -- just because they can see clearly at a distance doesn't mean they don't have a problem
        up close.  
        <br>
        (Exophoria/Esophoria: Muscle imbalance, fixed with either prism reading glasses or eye exercises.  Intermittent, not visible without cover test) <br>
        (Astigmatism: A type of refractive error; discuss corneal shape and how astigmatism refracts onto retina.  Only fixable through glasses.)

      <h3>Kids Eye Safety</h3>
      <p>
        <br>
        It seems like kids are always finding ways to hurt themselves.  Many of these ways are minor, like soap or dirt in the eye, 
        but others can be serious and even permanently damage their vision. There are even some injuries that are suprisingly common 
        but virtually unheard of by anhone other than those who work with eyes. Knowing about these various injuries helps not only to
        prevent them but also gives you the knowledge you need in order to treat them if they do happen.<br>
        (Hyphemas:  Solely caused by trauma.  Immediate medical attention. Symptoms include photophobia, terrible pain, possible nausea.  Blood may be visible at bottom of anterior chamber)<br>
        (Corneal Abrasions: "Rug burn" of the cornea, mostly heals itself with time but can be incredibly painful. Patch and sleep if pain is light (CL patch for older kids), otherwise medical attention. Can lead to eye infections.<br>
        (Black Eyes: Cold compresses. Medical attention is highly recommended due to possible consequences, including retinal detachment and orbital fractures.  Symptoms to be aware of: black spots, floaters, flashing lights.)<br>
        (Foreign Bodies: Wash with saline solution, NOT TAP WATER. If "loose", meaning on the white part of the eye and not embedded, can be removed with damp q-tip.  Otherwise get medical attention.)<br>
