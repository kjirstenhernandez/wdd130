                <p>80% of what we learn comes from vision, and recently studies have shown that 60% of 
                    "problem-learners" have an undiagnosed eye disorder. How did that happen? Because school 
                    screenings only focus on distance vision. Nearsightedness, meaning things at a distance
                    appear blurred but clearer closer-up, poses the biggest risk to learning, there are still
                    many vision disorders that happen at near-vision whic can still greatly impede learning,
                    and tend to be much harder to detect. This is why taking your child for an eye exam before 
                    they start school is so important -- just because they can see clearly at a distance 
                    doesn't mean they don't have a problem up close.</p>

                        These conditions are typically caused by a muscle or a nerve imbalance of the eye; 
                        esophoria causes an inward turn of the eye and exophoria causes an outward turn. Unlike
                        a tropia (a "lazy eye"), phorias are indiscernbile except by special testing at an eye doctor's office, 
                        usually initially through a cover test then confirmed by additional testing.  Many phorias
                        don't cause any problems, but when they do they can impede learning by causing eyestrain, headaches,
                        poor concentration, difficulty reading, and fatigue.  Studies have even indicated that phorias have
                        a strong correlation with dyslexia.

                    <p>Treatment often includes prescription glasses and vision therapy. Diagnosis by an Optometrist or Ophthalmologist
                        is essential in finding the right treatment for the condition.

                    <p class="vision-pg">
                        In a hypothetically perfect-shaped eye, the cornea (the clear covering over the iris) is perfectly round, like
                        a basketball.  However, 1/3 of all people have a cornea that looks more like a football - it has two curves to the 
                        front of it.  This is called an astigmatism.  Astigmatism is very common, but often overlooked by school screenings
                        because squinting greatly improves the vision from it, and kids often don't notice having to squint to see. Recent
                        studies have shown that children with high and moderate astigmatism have a significant decrease in reading fluency,
                        as well as poor academic performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Glasses is the primary treatment for astigmatism, and can have a substantial impact on kids with astigmatism. In 
                        the same study, students with high-astigmatism improved their reading speed by almost seven words per minute after
                        receiving glasses. A prescription from an Eye Doctor is required to receive glasses for astigmatism.

                    <p>Taking your kids to an eye doctor is essential for diagnosing vision conditions before they
                        become a problem, and many medical insurances will cover the visit.  It's recommended to have
                        your child examined by an Optometrist or Ophthalmologist before they start school.
