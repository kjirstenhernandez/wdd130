                <h6 class="banner-info">The eyes of children help them take in the world around them, and we're here to make sure 
                    you as parents and educators are prepared to help them do so. Because when their eyes are working 
                    at their full potential, kids can reach theirs.

                <p>Most people won’t argue when you say that any parent or teacher’s 
                primary concern is the health and well-being of a child, and that eyes
                are essential for development. However, most people also don’t think about
                how connected both of those things are! At EyeLearn we hope to raise awareness
                for the things that people oftentimes don’t know, and wouldn’t know unless 
                you’ve either attended Medical School or Optometry School, that can hurt kids
                either physically or academically.
