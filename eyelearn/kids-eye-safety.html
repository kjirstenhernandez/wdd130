                It seems like kids are always finding ways to hurt themselves. Many of these ways are minor, 
                like soap or dirt in the eye, but others can be serious and even permanently damage their vision.
                There are even some injuries that are suprisingly common but virtually unheard of by anhone other 
                than those who work with eyes. Knowing about these various injuries helps not only to prevent 
                them but also gives you the knowledge you need in order to treat them if they do happen.

                <h2>Hyphema</h2>
                <p>How many times have you seen a kid get hit in the eye a nerf gun? A ball? How about someone
                    else's elbow?  If you haven't, we sure have!  They're one of the most common ways of kids being
                    injured, and they often result in hyphemas, which are solely caused by trauma.  There are no blood
                    vessels in the cornea itself, but when it is hit with enough force a blood vessel in the iris to 
                    break (think of it like a Newton's cradle).  The blood pools at the bottom of the front of
                    the eye; this is called a hyphema.  Hyphemas are dangerous because the blood can block an important
                    area of the eye that allows another type of fluid to drain, and if it can't drain the pressure of 
                    the eye builds up and can cause light sensitivity, nausea, and blindess.<br>To prevent aginst this 
                    kind of injury, make sure your kids are wearing safety glasses when playing sports or with any kind 
                    of air-projected toys.  If an injury is ever sustained, immediate medical attention is recommended in 
                    order to treat it properly and avoid permanent damage.

                <h2>Corneal Abrasions</h2>
                <p>The cornea, the outermost surface of the eye, is made of the most tightly-compacted nerve fibers of
                    anywhere in the body.  This is why when you get a hair in your eye it hurts so badly, but if it were 
                    anywhere else you wouldn't even notice it.  A "scratch" across this fragile surface, thereby exposing
                    the sensitive nerve fibers underneath, is a corneal abrasion.  Kids are particularly prone to these 
                    purely because kids play around a alot; they spend a lot more time playing outside than most adults,
                    not to mention their tendency to play sports, affinity for throwing things around, and their general
                    love of roughhousing.  Abrasions can occur from just about anything getting in or hitting their eye;
                    even a small grand of sand from the sandbox can get caught under the lid and scratch every time they
                    blink. <br>Though wearing safety glasses during sports can cut down on the risk of abrasion for those particular
                    activities, you can't realistically ask kids to wear safety glasses everytime they play outside, play
                    with toys, or roughhouse; even though you'd like to.  So unfortunately prevention oftentimes isn't an
                    option for corneal abrasions.  However, if your child is complaining about pain everytime they blink, 
                    especially after playing in an environment where something could have gotten in their eye, the first
                    thing you should do is rinse it with a saline solution, NOT TAP WATER. Then use your best judgement: 
                    If the child still feels like something is in their eye, but isn't in a lot of pain, then let them 
                    sleep on it.  The cornea is one  of the fastest healing tissues in the body, and will likely be better 
                    by morning.  However, if they are in enough pain that you're either worried, or that they won't be
                    able to sleep, then take them to be checked by an eye doctor.  They'll be able to look and see if an
                    abrasion is present and provide treatment for it.  They'll also likely prescribe an antibiotic too, 
                    since a corneal abrasion puts the eye at greater risk for an infection.

                <h2>Ecchymosis, aka "Black Eyes"</h2>
                <p>We've said it before and we'll say it again: it seems like kids are always finding ways to hurt themselves,
                    and a lot of the time it ends up with a black eye, or ecchymosis in medical terms.  Ecchymosis is bruising
                    around the eye that can be purple, black, dark blue, or even yellow as they're healing.  They occur after
                    trauma to the eye, such as a baseball hitting the eye, a punch to the face, or walking into a pole.  The
                    trauma causes bleeding and swelling, like other bruises they can be sensitive and look pretty bad.  <br>Most
                    black eyes are preventable through the use of safety glasses, especially in cases of sports and outdoor play.
                    Kids are kids though, and you can't chase them around with safety glasses all of the time.  Most black eyes are
                    minor and will get better on their own, but sometimes they can be apried with something more
                    serious, such as a retinal detachment or a blowout fracture.  As such, we always recommend taking your child
                    for immediate medical attention after sustaining trauma to the eye, regardless of whether or not a black
                    eye occurs. We also recommend a cold pack after getting hit in the eye to decrease the swelling.

                <p>Accidents happen, even when you do your best to preven them.  If your child has sustained an injury, taking 
                    them to an eye doctor is the best way for them to get the treatment they need to get back to playing.
