    <p>I'm married with one son, who just turned a year old in October.  Together we live in Springville, UT.  We've been getting a lot of snow recently, but not enough for my taste!  I love the snow, and I'd be happy with a few more feet.</p>
    <p>I work as an ophthalmic technician, which means I love eyes inside and out!  I get to work under my mom, who is one of the Optometrists at the practice.  I love doing what I do, but it's an entry-level job and doesn't offer a wage for a growing family.</p>
    <p>For hobbies I collect and play vinyl records (mostly '70s and '80s, but a few '50s and modern).  I also love gardening and reading.  My favorite genre is non-fiction, but I'll read "Tom Sawyer" during the summer and "Jacob T. Marley" during Christmas.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to major in Web Development and Software Design because I love computers.  I'm hoping it will also help me to provide a home for my family,
    and allow us to continue to live in Utah - which is getting to be very expensive!
